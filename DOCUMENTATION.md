## Versioning
We try to follow the [Semver Standard](https://semver.org/).

This means that:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,

MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and

PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```

In some cases, the version in the PyOS program may read as `X.Y.Z-base-BRANCH`, and is caused because changes have been made in the branch for the upcoming  `X.Y.Z` release, but have not yet been tagged on GitHub.

An example of this would be a change in the `master` branch that has not yet been tagged, or formally released, on GitHub. Treat these releases as a pre-release. These are based of their respective branches and may be unstable, or have broken and/or missing features.

For a stable release, please use a release that is [tagged on GitHub](https://github.com/Prouser123/PyOS/releases/latest).
